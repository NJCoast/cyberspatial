            <h1>User-Friendly Geospatial Data at Your Fingertips</h1>  
            <p>NJcoast gives municipalities throughout New Jersey access to the same powerful geospatial web environment currently being used by the World Bank, the United Nations and the U.S. State Department to manage critical disaster recovery and humanitarian aid efforts. Registered users will have centralized access to the most up-to-date releases of dozens of GIS layers maintained by the State Office of Information Technologies, and can even integrate local municipal datasets such as properties and parcels, critical facilities, infrastructure networks, public works, and zoning &mdash; in one web environment. Users can chose the layers they wish to visualize, annotate and securely exchange with team members across and outside their municipality. Municipal officials can now become their own Geographic Information System (GIS) experts, capable of efficiently cataloging the location, attributes and condition of municipal assets without having to learn or maintain sophisticated software.</p>

            <h5>tools</h5>
            <h1>A Growing Library of Custom Tools for Decision Making</h1>  
            <p>NJcoast will build out, over time, a number of tools to assist municipalities in generating additional GIS data critical to decision making. For example, the <b>Storm Hazard Projection Tool</b> gives municipal officials the unprecedented ability to rapidly simulate the impact of hurricanes and nor’easters on their communities with the same level of accuracy as the most sophisticated models run by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Users will be able to visualize in near real-time the anticipated wind speeds and storm surges across the state’s municipalities for the scenario of their choosing or for the latest track information from the National Hurricane Center. The interactive functionality of this tool even allows users to alter storm path to evaluate “what if” and “worst case scenarios” that further consider the effects of degraded dunes, variable tides and even sea level rise -- all within a matter of minutes. All these simulations can be quickly shared with other users with a click of a button.</p>
